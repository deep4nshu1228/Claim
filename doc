Training Methodology:

To ensure accurate and leakage-free forecasts, the model training followed a walk-forward validation approach:

Cohort-Based Forecasting:

Data was structured by (dispatch_month, vehicle_age) so that each cohort (dispatch month) could be tracked across its lifecycle (ages 1–60).

Walk-Forward Validation:

For forecasting a given month M, the model was trained only on data available prior to M.

This prevents the model from using any future information, maintaining real-world forecasting conditions.

Sequential Horizon Forecasting:

Forecasts were generated month-by-month for each vehicle age.

For long horizons (up to 60 months ahead), predictions from earlier steps were fed into later steps, with error correction applied for drift mitigation.

Feature Availability Control:

All rolling statistics, lags, and EMAs were calculated only up to M-1 for month M’s prediction.

This ensured the strict temporal integrity of features.

Hyperparameter Tuning:

Grid search and cross-validation were applied within the walk-forward framework to optimize model parameters for XGBoost and LightGBM.





6. Challenges Faced & Solutions
Challenge	Description	Solution
Data Leakage	Future claim data was unintentionally used in training.	Enforced strict temporal cutoff; ensured model only sees data available at prediction time.
Error Accumulation	Long-horizon forecasts degraded in accuracy.	Introduced post-prediction adjustment factor (+5%) for months far in future.
Sparse Data for Higher Ages	Few claims after 48+ months.	Used extrapolation and smoothing for older ages.
Multiple Date Formats	Dispatch & claim data from different sources had mismatched formats.	Standardized all date formats to YYYY-MM Period type.

7. Filters & Business Rules
Exclude vehicles with dispatch volume < X for a month (to avoid unstable cost per vehicle).

Map plant and model codes consistently across historical changes.

Apply cost caps to avoid influence from exceptional large claims.

8. Evaluation Metrics & Results
Metrics Used:

MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) for percentage-based accuracy.

R² Score for goodness of fit.

Performance Summary:

Dataset	MAPE	R²
Train	8.9%	0.56
Test	11.5%	0.56

Interpretation:

MAPE < 12% indicates strong accuracy for business forecasting needs.

R² above 0.5 is reasonable given variability in warranty claims.

9. Model Improvements Over Time
Added seasonality handling for claim peaks.

Developed plant-specific models instead of global model for better granularity.

Applied SHAP analysis to understand feature contributions (vehicle age, dispatch volume, model type were most influential).

Introduced long-horizon correction factor for stability.

10. Final Forecast Delivery
Forecast Horizon:

60 months from latest dispatch cohort in dataset.

Output Format:

Excel file with columns: dispatch_month, model, plant, age_month, forecast_cost.

Pivot-table ready for finance and planning teams.

11. Future Enhancements
Incorporate macroeconomic & inflation factors into cost projections.

Use NeuralProphet or deep learning for better seasonality and trend modeling.

Automate model retraining and reporting via CI/CD pipeline and cloud deployment.
