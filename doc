5. Modeling Approaches
The forecasting solution was implemented using machine learning regression models, with a focus on capturing both seasonal patterns and age-based lifecycle effects in warranty costs.

Models Used:
XGBoost Regressor

LightGBM Regressor

These models were selected due to their ability to handle:

Non-linear relationships.

Mixed feature types (categorical, continuous, cyclical).

Large datasets with high dimensionality.

Features Utilized in Training:
Temporal (Dispatch-related):

dispatch_month_sin and dispatch_month_cos → Cyclical encoding of the dispatch month to represent seasonality.

Temporal (Warranty-related):

warranty_month_sin and warranty_month_cos → Cyclical encoding of warranty claim month to capture seasonal claim patterns.

Lifecycle Attributes:

vehicle_age → Number of months since dispatch (1 to 60).

Categorical Identifiers (Encoded):

model → Encoded vehicle model or model category.

plant → Encoded manufacturing plant.

Historical Cost Trends:

cost_lag → Warranty cost from the previous month (M-1).

rolling_mean → Mean warranty cost over the preceding n months before M.

rolling_std_dev → Standard deviation over the preceding n months before M.

ema → Exponential moving average of warranty costs up to M-1.

All temporal features were engineered strictly from historical data up to M-1 to avoid data leakage.

6. Challenges Faced & Solutions
Challenge	Description	Solution
Data Leakage	Future claim data was unintentionally used in training.	Enforced strict temporal cutoff; ensured model only sees data available at prediction time.
Error Accumulation	Long-horizon forecasts degraded in accuracy.	Introduced post-prediction adjustment factor (+5%) for months far in future.
Sparse Data for Higher Ages	Few claims after 48+ months.	Used extrapolation and smoothing for older ages.
Multiple Date Formats	Dispatch & claim data from different sources had mismatched formats.	Standardized all date formats to YYYY-MM Period type.

7. Filters & Business Rules
Exclude vehicles with dispatch volume < X for a month (to avoid unstable cost per vehicle).

Map plant and model codes consistently across historical changes.

Apply cost caps to avoid influence from exceptional large claims.

8. Evaluation Metrics & Results
Metrics Used:

MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) for percentage-based accuracy.

R² Score for goodness of fit.

Performance Summary:

Dataset	MAPE	R²
Train	8.9%	0.56
Test	11.5%	0.56

Interpretation:

MAPE < 12% indicates strong accuracy for business forecasting needs.

R² above 0.5 is reasonable given variability in warranty claims.

9. Model Improvements Over Time
Added seasonality handling for claim peaks.

Developed plant-specific models instead of global model for better granularity.

Applied SHAP analysis to understand feature contributions (vehicle age, dispatch volume, model type were most influential).

Introduced long-horizon correction factor for stability.

10. Final Forecast Delivery
Forecast Horizon:

60 months from latest dispatch cohort in dataset.

Output Format:

Excel file with columns: dispatch_month, model, plant, age_month, forecast_cost.

Pivot-table ready for finance and planning teams.

11. Future Enhancements
Incorporate macroeconomic & inflation factors into cost projections.

Use NeuralProphet or deep learning for better seasonality and trend modeling.

Automate model retraining and reporting via CI/CD pipeline and cloud deployment.
