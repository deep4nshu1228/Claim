7. Evaluation Metrics & Results
1. Evaluation Approach
The model was evaluated using both back-testing on historical data and forward simulation to mimic the real-time forecasting process. Metrics were computed at the monthly level and aggregated for each forecast horizon.

2. Metrics Used
Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):
Selected as the primary evaluation metric to capture the relative accuracy of forecasts across different vehicle models and warranty cost scales.

R² Score:
Used as a secondary metric to assess how well the model explained the variance in actual costs.

Directional Accuracy:
Monitored to ensure the model correctly predicted upward or downward trends in costs, even if magnitude errors existed.

3. Results Overview
Across most forecast horizons, average percentage error (MAPE) ranged between 10% and 15%.

Performance was strongest in the short to mid-term horizons (up to 12 months), where error accumulation was minimal.

Longer horizons (24+ months) saw a gradual rise in MAPE due to compounded forecast errors — a direct result of the sequential prediction process.

Retraining after every six iterations significantly reduced the magnitude of error accumulation, improving stability in the 13–36 month range.

4. Effect of Error Accumulation
In a rolling forecast setup, each month’s prediction is based on the previous month’s predicted values, not actuals.

Small deviations in early months — even as low as ±2% — compounded over time, leading to an additional 3–5% increase in error in later forecast horizons.

Without retraining checkpoints, errors in the final 12 months of the 60-month forecast could exceed 20% MAPE; with the retraining strategy, this was brought down to the 10–15% range.

This highlighted the importance of iterative correction in long-horizon warranty cost forecasting.





9. Model Improvements Over Time
Added seasonality handling for claim peaks.

Developed plant-specific models instead of global model for better granularity.

Applied SHAP analysis to understand feature contributions (vehicle age, dispatch volume, model type were most influential).

Introduced long-horizon correction factor for stability.
