8. Model Improvement Over Time
Plan to incorporate longer-term historical trends (beyond current 60-month window) to enhance stability and robustness of forecasts.

As additional dispatch and warranty records flow in, the model will benefit from richer historical actuals for training.

Over time, increased data volume will naturally smooth out volatility and noise in certain model categories.

Maintain an ongoing model improvement cycle with periodic retraining, hyperparameter tuning, and feature enhancements.

Integrate more granular warranty unit-level details to improve the accuracy and explainability of cost estimations.
