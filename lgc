Warranty Cost Forecasting – Logic Document
1. Objective
To forecast the warranty cost for the next 60 months for each vehicle based on its dispatch month, using historical warranty cost patterns and volumes.

2. Data Inputs
Source: Historical warranty claim data and dispatch records.

Data Structure:

Plant	Model	Dispatch Month	Age (Months)	Volume	Costing
A	X	2020-01	1	50	1000
A	X	2020-01	2	48	800
...	...	...	...	...	...

Field Details:

Plant: Manufacturing plant code or name.

Model: Vehicle model name or code.

Dispatch Month: The month in which the vehicle was dispatched.

Age (Months): The number of months since dispatch (1 = next month after dispatch, up to 60).

Volume: Number of vehicles in that plant-model-dispatch-age combination.

Costing: Total warranty cost incurred for that combination.

3. Pre-Processing Logic
Data Cleaning

Ensure dispatch month and age are in correct date/number formats.

Remove or impute missing costing or volume values.

Exclude records where volume ≤ 0 or cost < 0 (if invalid).

Data Aggregation

Group by Plant, Model, Dispatch Month, Age.

Aggregate:

Volume = SUM(volume)

Costing = SUM(costing)

Cost Per Unit Calculation

CPU = Costing / Volume

This represents average cost per vehicle for that age.

4. Historical Pattern Extraction
Pivot Table / Matrix Creation

Index: Dispatch Month

Columns: Age 1 → Age 60

Values: CPU

Average CPU per Age

For each Plant + Model, calculate historical average CPU for each age from historical data.

Trend/Seasonality Analysis

Identify if CPU has seasonality by month-of-year or age-based decay pattern.

5. Forecasting Logic
Forecasting CPU

For each Plant + Model:

Predict CPU for ages 1–60 based on historical averages or a time-series model (e.g., exponential smoothing, regression with age).

Adjust for inflation, policy changes, or cost index (if available).

Forecasting Volume

Get projected dispatch volumes for future months.

Assign age = 1 for next month after dispatch, increment until age 60.

Final Cost Calculation

Forecasted Cost = Forecasted CPU × Forecasted Volume for each Plant, Model, Dispatch Month, and Age.

6. Output Structure
Plant	Model	Dispatch Month	Age	Forecasted Volume	Forecasted CPU	Forecasted Cost

7. Example
Historical Data (Sample)
Plant A, Model X, Dispatch Jan 2020

Age	Volume	Costing	CPU
1	50	1000	20
2	48	800	16.67

Forecast Logic:
If CPU for Age 1 historically = 20, and projected volume for Age 1 = 60, then:
Forecasted Cost = 20 × 60 = 1200

8. Assumptions
Warranty cost patterns by age remain stable unless adjusted for known factors.

Dispatch volumes are accurate for forecasting horizon.

External cost adjustments (inflation, currency, policy) applied separately.
